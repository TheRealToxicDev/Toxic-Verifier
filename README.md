# Please Note

> This bot is a ***Single Server*** Bot and can only be used in One Guild.

## Installation 

This basic, simple - yet very useful verification bot for Discord - built on [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) 

### Requirements:

> Node.js version v8.0.0+ (to check your node version, you can type  `node --version` - to update Node, use [nvm](http://nvm.sh) and `nvm install 9.5.0` (latest version as of this edit) which works here (can `nvm install <version>` and `nvm use <version` anytime to switch)

> Git (to clone the repository, which is the easiest way)

The rest of the dependencies (just discord.js) are handled through nvm. 

**Any unmet peer dependency warnings after using npm to install can be safely ignored as they are not needed for this project and this is the normal behavior within discord.js**

---

After you ensure that your Node is the correct version, simply install the dependencies through npm:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/TheRealToxicDev/Toxic-Verifier.git && cd Toxic-verifier && npm install -g 

```

(you can also do each command above separately, these just combine three with `&&`)


### Configuration:

> (1) You must edit `verify.js` accordingly. All the message strings are consts in `verify.js` . Specifically, you have to edit:

```js

const welcomemsg = ``
const verifymsg = ''
const completemsg = ``

```

Where:

`welcomemsg:` the message to send on guild join
`verifymsg:` the message that the users must type to gain the verified role - include the token here (see below)
`completemsg:` the message sent upon successful verification

- The `verifymsg` can be edited, just remember this is what the string will be that the user must type. In the latter part of `verify.js`, there will be a `member.send(`Stuff here...`);` which I mention at the top of the file in a comment with instructions: 

- The `verifymsg` const at the top is *not* the same, but it is the string they must match perfectly to actually verify their account and get the role assigned. Can be anything you want, for example if you just want it to be the token with no message, simply edit `const verifymsg = '{token}';`

- Just remember that when you edit the welcomemsg (`const welcomemsg`) with your message, include what the member has to post to get verified. If you change the `verifymsg` to '{token}', then you should say something like `Please post the following: {token}` or whatever you wish. If the user doesn't know what they need to do, then it will be obviously confusing! The examples are in `verify.js` for you to see.

> (2) You must also edit `config.json` accordingly. Specifically, you have to edit:

```json

{
	"token": "",
	"guild": "",
	"role": "",
	"playing": ""	
}
```

Where:

`token:` your bot's token.
`guild:` the guild ID (not name) for the bot.
`role:` the role ID (not name) for the bot to assign upon verification. **Must be a valid/active role, bot must have role-assign permissions.**
`playing:` the game that the bot shows playing on Discord.


- Save the changes and continue onwards.


### Permissions (important)

- The point of this bot is to manage your guild so that users can't see much - if at all - unless verified. You need to make sure that the channel permissions are correct for the roles.

- When I say "MEMBER" role I mean the role most of the members will have, and the role once verified by the bot going forwards. So this is the role ID that will go in the ROLE const in `verify.js` 

- So, here is a guide - and I am sorry for the detail, but this is one of the most common/one of the easiest things to mess up due to the nature of the permissions system being different and channel overrides:

#### The easy method:

> Edit the guild-wide permissions for the @everyone role in your server to not have READ_MESSAGES as a guild permission. The downside to this is that users cannot read any messages, even in say an announcements or serverinfo channel, or if you have a helproom for new users they can't either. So, I do it the "hard" way, but it's (frankly) the proper way to do it and a one time task. Anyway, if you do this route, then add a members role with permissions to read messages, etc. on a guild level.

---

#### The 'proper' method:

> Your "main" room (the general chat room assigned by discord) is special as it can't be deleted. It also can't have the read messages permission revoked like other channels. But we can do this another way.

> **For every channel except the general/main one**, the @everyone role should have deny (so edit **channel permissions** for the @everyone role and make sure it has the READ_MESSAGES permission set to red/off/disabled). This will cause most channels to not be seen at all. 

> Create a role for your members, which has access to the main channels in your guild. All your members mainly will be in this role, including the new ones after verifying. This is the role that the bot will assign to verified users. Now, edit all the **channel permissions** for *every channel your regular members should be able to access* and give the READ_MESSAGES permission to green/on/enabled. 

> Lastly, in your general channel, we can't disable the READ_MESSAGES. But, for the @everyone role, we can disable `READ_  MESSAGE_HISTORY` - which will show the channel to the unverified user, but it will have no content in it unless they are verified and then they can see history again. For **just the general/main channel** we should also, in addition to enabling READ_MESSAGES for our members role, enable the `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` for the permissions heirarchy. The optional step is to disable `SEND_MESSAGES` in our main/general room for the @everyone role. I personally don't, because I use that room if anyone has questions or whatnot, so I allow unverified/new members to send messages, but they cannot view the history, so it's like a blank slate for them. If you *do* disable `SEND_MESSAGES` for @everyone, they won't be able to really message anywhere, so make sure you have a read-only for all channel like announcements with an FAQ or whatnot. Lastly, if you do disable `SEND_MESSAGES` for the general room @everyone role, be sure to enable it for the members role too. 

> If this was all done properly then you don't need to do anything else. Remember, for the other channels, we only need to modify the `READ_MESSAGES` on each channel for the @everyone role to red/disable/off -- doing just that will hide the channel, so no need to make everything disabled, that is bad practice and causes issues for many down the road. Leave the rest of the permissions at the default setting. Just enable `READ_MESSAGES` for the member role for all channels.

> If you have an announcements channel, this is fine, of course, just make it read-only which it probably is for everyone. Here the @everyone role wants to have `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` and `READ_MESSAGES` but not `SEND_MESSAGES`, which should be the default behavior of a serverinfo/announcements/FAQ page or the like for your members role too.

> ***It is very important that the above gets done correctly, otherwise the bot won't do its job. Well...it will, but if your @everyone role can message and view channels freely, then assigning them a MEMBER role will not do much for verification**

Here is a cheatsheet:


Channels  | @everyone role | Members Role 
------------- | -------------| -------------
announcements  | HISTORY: YES, READ: YES, SEND: NO | HISTORY: YES, READ: YES, SEND: NO
main/general default | HISTORY: NO, SEND: YES/NO CHOICE | READ: YES HISTORY: YES SEND: YES
some-channel | READ: NO | READ: YES
some-channel-2 | READ: NO | READ: YES
some-channel-3 | READ: NO | READ: YES
staff-channel or private  | READ: NO  | READ: NO


You shouldn't touch other permissions when you don't need to ;) 



> Lastly, if you have any **MUTED** roles by bots, make sure they are above the Members role in the channel heirarchy, and just have that role set to `SEND_MESSAGES` disabled. This way if you give a Member role the SEND_MESSAGES permission for a specific channel, the Muted role will only work if it is above in the ranking, otherwise it will be useless. (this applies to Mute actions via. bots for now)

So.....assuming you don't have any overrides, this will work üèÜ

### Getting a Bot Token and Invite Link
[here is a good guide from jagrosh - this page applies for getting a token and client ID](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Getting-a-Bot-Token)

---

### Connecting

- Invite the bot using the link to your server. It will show offline until we start it.

- `cd` to your directory if you haven't already. By this step I assume you have ran the `npm install -g` and should see a `node_modules` folder, a `verify.js` file, and a README file. Inside that directory, which I am assuming is `Toxic-Verifier` if you followed the first step, simply use node to install.

- **NOTE:** Make sure you have your `verify.js` configured (the strings edited to your desire). Again, if you look at the `verify.js` file it has all the comments for information on changing the strings, and by default it has our base implementation. 

Start the app: (**it is well worth it to see the below section as well!**)

```bash
$ node verify.js
```

---

### Keeping the Bot Online

You will want to keep this online even if your terminal window times out. We have two main options. I *strongly* reccomend the first, pm2, as it is built for node and works very well - manages restarts if needed, can map it to `systemd` so it will restart automatically on server/VPS/etc. reboots, is able to be used to monitor the status, and does default logging, plus a ton of other potential things we don't need for this app. 

Don't forget to terminate any sessions you have of the bot running before doing this. 


#### pm2 - Strongly Recommended 

> pm2 can be found here: https://github.com/Unitech/pm2

You can read their quick install instructions, it takes just a minute. Please make sure you run `pm2 update` if you have pm2 but haven't updated in a while. It is seamless.

Once installed, instead of using `node verify.js` we go in our same directory and can run:

`pm2 start verify.js --name "somename"` where you can edit somename to call your application.

Make sure the node version of pm2 is adequate. It is more than likely fine, but I personally run my applications with PM2 the following way:

- In the folder for the bot, create a file called botname.json (whatever you wish)

- Use an editor (this is just a a few lines we will be needing, so I just do it with nano in the terminal) to edit the file.

- I am using it on the latest node - if you don't have this and wish to, again can use [nvm](http://nvm.sh) and do `nvm install v9.5.0` which will switch and install that node version for you.


```json

[{
	"name": "application-name",
	"exec_interpreter": "node@7.9.0",
	"script": "verify.js"
}]

```
- Save this file in the same directory as `verify.js`. I called it `verify.json` (note: we can add a lot of things to this json file, like `"interpreter_args":` but we do not need that here. Just good to know for the future if this comes in handy.

- Now we can run:

```bash

NVM_DIR=/path/to/.nvm/ pm2 start verify.json 

```

- The path to your nvm can be found by typing `which node` (or `which npm`) and it will output something like:

```bash

# example output of which node with nvm

vlexar@node1:~$ which node
/home/vlexar/.nvm/versions/node/v9.5.0/bin/node

# or if you are running under the root user, it may look like

root@lemp-512mb-nyc3-01:~# which node
/root/.nvm/versions/node/v9.5.0/bin/node

```

- Either way, the path is the part up to the `/.nvm/` directory. We should use the absolute path here, so in my case: `/home/vlexar/.nvm/` is the path to nvm, or in the other example it would be `/root/.nvm/` 

- So we can now run: 

```bash

$ NVM_DIR=/path/to/.nvm/ pm2 start verify.json  # with our updated path :-) 

```

Running this will start the application reading the json file we edited, which tells it to use the node v7.9.0 interpreter, and the application name for pm2. All done! You should see the bot come online if it has been invited/added to the guild.

> **RUNNING AS SYSTEMD** Once we did all this with pm2, we can have it so it will restart on things like server reboots. For Linux, `systemd` manages the startup tasks. Once we started the bot, we can simply run `pm2 startup systemd` which will take your pm2 projects and run them in the systemd for autostartup on harder reboots.

  ```bash
  
  pm2 unstartup [platform]                    disable and clear auto startup    
  pm2 startup [platform]                      setup script for pm2 at boot   
  
  where [platform]=systemd,upstart,launchd,rcd   # one of these, with Linux it is just systemd
 
 ```
 (this step was optional re: systemd, but it is a good step to take and only is a few seconds to enable as pm2 will automate the config)

#### tmux - if you wish 

> If for some reason you don't want pm2, then tmux will work for the basic task. Their page is here: https://github.com/tmux/tmux

> Linux based and macOS systems (which, if you couldn't tell, this is written that way) are going to either come with tmux installed depending on the provider, or you can get it by doing `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install tmux
` on Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo yum install update && sudo yum -y install tmux` on CentOS/RHEL based systems, if those don't work you may need to do something like `yum epel-release` before, but I digress.. on macOS you can use a package manager, like [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - which is super easy to install - and then do `brew install tmux`

> tmux is fairly easy, [but there's a ton of things you can read about it if you wish.](https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read) 

- If you use tmux here, you would just need to run something like this once tmux is installed:

```bash

$ cd Toxic-Verifier 
$ tmux new -s Toxic-Verifier 
$ node verify.js

```
And do `CONTROL+B+D` on your keyboard to detach from the session. To attach, do `tmux a -t [name]` - here `tmux a -t Toxic-Verifier ` and `tmux ls` to list all processes. To kill a session, you can do `tmux kill-session -t [name]` - so here `tmux kill-session -t Toxic-Verifier ` 

There's a lot more to tmux, but that's all you need for this if you do decide to use it instead of pm2, which I again strongly suggest you use instead here.
